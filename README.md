# Simulation of a Network Infrastructure Design for Amsic Integrated School

This repository contains the complete documentation and simulation files for our capstone project titled "Simulation of a Network Infrastructure Design for Amsic Integrated School." The project focuses on designing and simulating a reliable and scalable network infrastructure that supports the school’s daily academic and administrative operations.

## Project Overview

Amsic Integrated School currently lacks a structured network infrastructure. To address this, we developed a cost-efficient simulated network design that ensures reliable connectivity, allows room for future expansion, and includes redundancy features to minimize downtime in case of failure.

### Key Objectives

1. To address the needs of Amsic Integrated School's network requirements by
analyzing their infrastructure needs

2. To design and simulate a network infrastructure tailored to the specific needs
of the school.
	● Wireless Network Implementation
	● Load Balancing
	● Redundancy
	● Scalability and Performance
	● Security Measures

3. To conduct stress tests and performance evaluations of the proposed network
through a simulated environment using iPerf.

## My Role

In this capstone project, I was actively involved in multiple areas:

- Documentation (Lead): I led the writing and compilation of the project documentation, including the rationale, objectives, system design, and technical explanations.  
- Network Design (Contributor): I contributed to the layout and planning of the network infrastructure, ensuring it meets the goals of scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.  
- Configuration (Contributor): I assisted in setting up the simulated network using Cisco Packet Tracer, helping with device configurations and addressing.  
- Testing and Validation (Contributor): I took part in performance testing and troubleshooting to ensure the network operates effectively under various conditions.  

## Tools Used

- EVE-NG
- Fortinet FortiGate
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Zabbix
- Microsoft Word / Google Docs
